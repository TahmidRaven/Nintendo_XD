     Preamble

 The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works.  You can redistribute it and/or
 modify it under the terms of the License, as published by the Free
 Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your
 option) any later version.

 This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
 but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
 MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
 GNU General Public License for more details.

 You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
 along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Terms and Conditions

 0. Definitions.

 “This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

 “Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.

 “The Program” refers to any work covered by this License.  Each licensee is
 addressed as “you”.

 “Modifications” means any work based on the Program, or any work that uses
 the Program in a way that is covered by this License.  The term “modification”
 is intended to include the source code and any further changes or additions
 to it.

 “Source code” means the preferred form for making modifications to the
 Program.

 “Object code” means any form of the Program other than the source code.

 1. Source Code.

 The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
 modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
 the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
 definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
 of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code distributed
 need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
 binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
 operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself
 accompanies the executable.

 If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
 designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
 from the same place satisfies the requirement to provide source code.

 2. Basic Permissions.

 You may copy, modify, distribute, and sublicense the Program, provided that
 you meet the following conditions:

 a) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

 b) You must distribute the source code for the modified version, or
    make it available, and you must license the modified version under
    this License.

 c) You must preserve the copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty for
    the original version, along with any relevant notices.

 3. Copyleft.

 The intent of the GPL is to ensure that every user has freedom to share and
 change software. To protect these rights, it requires that modified versions
 of the Program be distributed under the same license. This guarantees that
 the freedoms you receive with the Program are also passed along to others.

 4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

 You may convey a modified version of the Program under the terms of this
 License, provided that you meet the conditions for modified versions:
    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
       that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    b) You must distribute the source code of the modified version, and you
       must license the modified version under this License.

 5. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

 You may convey a work in object code or executable form under the terms
 of this License, provided that you:
    a) Provide the source code, or make it available.
    b) Include the complete license text, including a reference to the GPLv3.

 6. Tivoization.

 If you modify the Program and convey the modified version to others, you
 must make sure that users are able to install their own versions of the
 software on the device it is running on, regardless of any hardware
 restrictions.

 7. Patent Protection.

 The GNU GPLv3 includes a clause that protects contributors from patent
 litigation by users of the software. You cannot use the software in a way
 that infringes the patents of the contributors.

 8. Compatibility with Other Licenses.

 The GPLv3 is more permissive than earlier versions, allowing you to
 combine it with other licenses under certain conditions.

 9. Termination.

 This License will terminate automatically if you violate any of its
 conditions. However, you can regain the license by complying with the
 License conditions within 30 days of the violation.

 10. Additional Terms.

 You can apply additional terms to your modifications, but these terms must
 not conflict with the GPLv3.
